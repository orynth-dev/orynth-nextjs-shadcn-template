For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

When using client-side hooks (useState and useEffect) in a component that's being treated as a Server Component by Next.js, always add the "use client" directive at the top of the file.

Do not write code that will trigger this error: "Warning: Extra attributes from the server: %s%s""class,style"

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, the shadcn/ui library, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist.

WALLET CONNECT INTEGRATION:
This template includes Solana wallet connect functionality powered by Reown AppKit. Follow these guidelines:

1. ALWAYS use the ConnectButton component from '../components/connect-button' when wallet functionality is needed
2. The wallet modal has maximum z-index and will appear on top of all other components
3. Wallet connection state is managed globally - no need to implement custom wallet logic
4. Import: `import { ConnectButton } from '../components/connect-button'`
5. Usage: Simply place `<ConnectButton />` where wallet connection is needed
6. The button automatically handles connection, disconnection, and wallet switching
7. DO NOT create custom wallet connection components - always use the provided ConnectButton
8. The wallet supports Solana mainnet by default with proper error handling
9. All wallet functionality is production-ready and optimized for performance

CRITICAL RULE: NEVER WRITE `package.json` directly use npm comands to install packages if needed
